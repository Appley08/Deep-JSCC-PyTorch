# Deep JSCC
This implements training of deep JSCC models for wireless image transmission as described in the paper [Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Wireless Image Transmission](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8723589) by Pytorch. And there has been a [Tensorflow implementation](https://github.com/irdanish11/DJSCC-for-Wireless-Image-Transmission).

This is my first time to use Pytorch and git to reproduce a paper, so there may be some mistakes. If you find any, please let me know. Thanks!
